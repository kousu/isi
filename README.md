ISI Tools
===========

These are a bunch of tools for dealing with the ISI Web of Science.
You can use them to extract, clean, and process article records in the [ISI Flat File format](TODO).

Some examples of the sorts of work that can be done with this data:
* Kieran Healy: [Gender and Citation](http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2015/02/25/gender-and-citation-in-four-general-interest-philosophy-journals-1993-2013/)
* Neal Caren: [A Sociology Citation Network](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu/a-sociology-citation-network/)

The tools are very alpha at this stage and have a heavy Unix bias.
Please submit bug reports and feature requests.
I would love to be useful to the wider world.

ISI Scraper

A tip:
once you are comfortable with the tool, write yourself a script `isi_scrape.logined.sh` like this
```
#!/bin/sh

HERE=$(dirname $0)
$HERE/isi_scrape.py -q <username> <password> "$@"
```
